# Kuki
This is a series of resources to teach French-learners (and others!) the different allophones of /k/ in French. The phoneme /k/ tends to be realized as the palatal allophone \[c\] in front of a front vowel such as /i/. In front of a back vowel like /u/, /k/ will be realized as a velar \[k]. 

# Content 
In this repository, you will find: 
- A collection of videos (normal and .5 speed) of the pronunciation and real-time EPG tongue/palate contact of pairs of French words containing /ki/ and /ku/.

- A heatmap of mean tongue/palate contact for each allophone based on five repetitions of different pairs of French words containing /ki/ and /ku/.
