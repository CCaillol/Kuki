# Kuki
This is a collection of resources to teach French-learners (and others!) the different allophones of /k/ in French. The phoneme /k/ tends to be realized as the palatal allophone \[c\] in front of a front vowel such as /i/. In front of a back vowel like /u/, /k/ will be realized as a velar \[k]. 

# Content 
In this repository, you will find: 
- A video at normal and .5 speed (with resynthetized speech using Praat (Boersma & Weenink, 2022)) of the pronunciation and real time EPG tongue/palate contact of /ku/ and /ki/. See kuki_example.mp4 and kuki_example_slow.mp4.
- A collection of videos at normal and .5 speed (with resynthetized speech) of the pronunciation and real-time EPG tongue/palate contact of pairs of French words containing /ki/ and /ku/. See Videos folder.

- A heatmap of mean tongue/palate contact for each allophone based on five repetitions of different pairs of French words containing /ki/ and /ku/.
